We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

* **Be Patient**: Remember everyone has different backgrounds and learning speeds

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Course instructors and repository maintainers are responsible for clarifying and
enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior. They will take appropriate and
fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
