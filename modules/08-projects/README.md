# Module 8: ML Project Development and Best Practices

## Overview
Bring everything together! Learn to develop complete ML projects following industry best practices.

## Learning Objectives
- Execute end-to-end ML projects
- Follow ML engineering best practices
- Consider ethical implications
- Prepare models for deployment
- Document work professionally

## Topics
1. **Project Workflow**: Problem → Data → Model → Deployment
2. **Best Practices**: Code organization, version control, documentation
3. **Model Deployment**: Saving models, APIs, cloud deployment
4. **ML Ethics**: Bias, fairness, privacy, interpretability
5. **Career Paths**: Roles, skills, job market

## Key Files
- `project_template/` - Complete project structure
- `deployment_example/` - Flask API example
- `ethics_case_studies.ipynb` - Real-world ethical issues
- `career_guide.md` - ML career information

## Final Project
**Weight**: 25% of total grade  
**Due**: End of Week 16

### Requirements
- Define clear problem statement
