# Module 2: Data Preprocessing and Exploration

## Overview
Master the art of data preparation - the most time-consuming but crucial step in any ML project. Learn to clean, transform, and explore data effectively.

## Learning Objectives
- Perform comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Handle missing data and outliers
- Engineer meaningful features
- Scale and normalize data appropriately
- Split data for training and validation

## Topics
1. **Data Loading**: CSV, JSON, databases, APIs
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Statistics, distributions, correlations
3. **Data Cleaning**: Missing values, duplicates, outliers
4. **Feature Engineering**: Creating, transforming, encoding features
5. **Feature Scaling**: StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler, RobustScaler
6. **Data Splitting**: Train-test split, stratification, cross-validation
